About Convert Image Format App

The Convert Image Format App project involves creating a web application that allows users to convert images from one format to another. The program uses HTML elements to create the structure of the user interface, which typically includes an area to upload the image file, options to select the desired output format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF), and a button to trigger the conversion process. The user must select a format and upload an image to process the image conversion. The application functions will handle the image file uploads, process the image data, perform the format conversion using libraries or built-in browser APIs, and provide the converted image to the user for download.
